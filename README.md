## Time to make the stars align
After the previous intern seriously messed up the telescope, it is now your job as the new intern to fix the captures in post!

Align the projections so they look right, and maybe get that internship extended!

## A submission for the Acerola Jam 0
This game was made for the Acerola Game Jam 0 with the theme "Aberration", between February 28th 2024 and March 14th 2024. For the source and credits, check out the "credits_and_attributions.txt" file, or view the credits in-game!

Since this is a jam-game, so the code base is a definitive mess, please keep that in mind!
